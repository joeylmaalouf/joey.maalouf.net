  <h1>What is this "net neutrality"?</h1>
  <p>Net neutrality, as it is commonly defined, is the idea that Internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all content equally, regardless of its source, destination, or subject matter. This prevents biased actions by ISPs, such as slowing down or even blocking access to a particular website that the ISP doesn’t like, or charging companies an exorbitant fee to enable their sites to actually load. Net neutrality isn’t quite happening yet, though. Net neutrality is one of the most important (yet overlooked) tenets of Internet usage, and all of us everyday users have a duty to guarantee this neutrality for the future.
  <h1>Why isn't this great idea already implemented?</h1>
  Unfortunately, there’s a debate today about whether or not net neutrality is a good thing. Proponents maintain that it allows an even playing field for all sites [1], while opponents argue that net neutrality would make it harder for ISPs to make a profit if they weren’t allowed to charge extra for an “Internet fast lane”. However, we already know that ISPs will take anything that we let them, and have no qualms taking advantage of their customers. In Seoul, South Korea, consumers can pay $30.30 per month for speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, while in San Francisco, CA, consumers can pay $30.00 per month for speeds of up to 200 megabits per second (thirty cents less for one fifth of the speed) [2]. This is just a comparison of the best “bang for your buck” services; there are other providers with slower, more expensive plans, but the general trend of US ISPs overcharging is the same. From this argument that ISPs are greedy, it logically follows that we need to limit the power that ISPs have over their customers, because the regional monopolies that ISPs have in many areas of the US prevent healthy competition and allow ISPs to do what they like without fear of losing customers. This leads into another pro-net neutrality argument: legislation that enforces net neutrality would also create some measure of competition amongst service providers. The reasoning for this is that if ISPs are able to change service based on content, then they could simply prevent their competitors’ pages from ever loading, thereby eliminating any possible rivals [3].</p>
  <h1>What's stopping us?</h1>
  <p>As we can see from the actions of ISPs, we need to overcome a few obstacles before we can achieve net neutrality. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is tasked with watching over the ISPs to ensure proper behavior. In 1934, the FCC passed the Communications Act, of which Title 2 regulates common carriers so that anyone who provides widespread service to the US cannot unjustly or unreasonably discriminate “ in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities or services” [4]. However, while this act has done well in terms of television and telephone service providers, ISPs are another story entirely. Since the Internet had not yet come into existence in 1934, the FCC recently proposed subjecting them to the regulations of Title 2. At first, this plan seemed to have succeeded; the FCC passed the Open Internet order in December 2010, but they only gave ISPs a fraction of the regulations to which other types of carriers are subjected, likely because Tom Wheeler (the chairman of the FCC) is a former cable lobbyist [5]. Despite these minor changes, the FCC can do nothing to actually impose their rulings on the ISPs. In January 2014, the DC Circuit Court ruled that the FCC holds no power to enforce net neutrality, since ISPs are not classified as common carriers under Title 2 of the Communications Act [6]. In February 2014, the FCC announced that they would try for a second attempt at enforcing net neutrality, hopefully in a way that the courts permit [7]. Currently, the FCC’s proposal allows for the sort of payment from content providers to ISPs to allow their content to load faster, but even President Obama has stated that he is against “differentiation in how accessible the Internet is to different users” [8]. In fact, Obama recently urged the FCC to “adopt the strongest possible rules” on net neutrality, including Title 2 [12].</p>
  <h1>How can I help?</h1>
  <p>How could your everyday Internet user make a difference towards net neutrality? Many websites participated in the “Internet Slowdown”, temporarily slowing down their sites for a day in order to show users what it would be like if the current proposal was accepted [9]. By doing so, they both spread awareness of the net neutrality cause and forced visitors to experience a potential yet preventable future. This opened the eyes of many users to what it would be like if the FCC’s proposal passed as it currently stands, and makes clear the next step that net neutrality advocates need to be taking: arguing for a change to the FCC’s proposed rules so that ISPs are classified as common carriers and thus fall under the jurisdiction of Title 2. When the FCC opened a public comment period in May 2014 about suggestions for their proposal, they received over one million responses [10]! This is more than they’ve ever gotten on any rule-making matter before, and the hope is that such an overwhelming show of support will affect the FCC’s final vote, rumored to be sometime before yearend [11]. Because of the aforementioned court rulings, there isn’t much leeway for the FCC to try writing new rules. Marvin Ammori, from the New America Foundation, says that “It will either be we win on Title II or we lose… The court decision leaves very little choice for a third way” [11]. This means that we all need to do two things: convince the FCC to change their proposed rules so that ISPs become considered common carriers, and persuade Congress to let the FCC’s proposal pass. Many different websites have premade templates for users to fill out with their contact information to quickly and easily show their support towards these causes, such as <a href="http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_fcc_proposal/">this one</a> and <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/tellfcc/">this one</a>.</p>
  <h1>What does this mean for the future?</h1>
  <p>Net neutrality is something that most Internet users take for granted, but, because of the recent court verdicts, it’s not a guarantee. In fact, earlier this year, Comcast refused to “provide its own customers the broadband speeds they’ve paid for unless Netflix also pays a ransom”, which translates to Comcast deliberately throttling the loading speed of Netflix for Comcast customers in order to extort money from Netflix [13]. This sort of business practice is unacceptable, especially for the consumers who are forced to pay more to cover the costs of this ransom tax. Anybody who doesn’t want their access to a website or service to be based upon that site’s tithes paid to ISPs needs to immediately take action by joining two causes: the first is to get the FCC to change their proposal to include ISPs under the blanket of “common carriers”, and the second is to get Congress to pass this proposal. If the United States doesn’t achieve some semblance of net neutrality, there will be nothing to inspire competition amongst ISPs, resulting in a stale market of low-quality service and no alternatives. The Internet will finally be fully censorable, with ISPs controlling exactly what does and doesn’t load. Can you imagine trying to watch your favorite show on Netflix, only to find out that Netflix didn’t pay their weekly tax to Comcast? Or waking up to find that Google and YouTube won’t load because Google won’t bow to Time Warner Cable? If you, like me, are against this future full of censorship and extortion, join the fight for net neutrality today!</p>
